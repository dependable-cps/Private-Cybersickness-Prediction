## Private-Cybersickness-Prediction 
This repository accompanies the paper Preserving Personal Space: Differentially Private Cybersickness Detection in Immersive Virtual Reality Environments, under submission ISMAR 2024. The repository contains the main code of DP-enabled private cybersickness deetction . The code is tested on Python 3.9, and GPUs are needed to accelerate neural network training and membership inference attacks.
